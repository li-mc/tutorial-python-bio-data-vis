Visualizing Biological Data in Python using plotly, with data from FANTOM5.<br>

Based on this tutorial: [https://plotly.com/python/v3/ipython-notebooks/bioinformatics/]<br>

Overall, this ended up being more of an exercise about translating to Python3 and Plotly4 from Python2 and Plotly3 than about data visualization.  Still pretty informative!  There is quite a lot left to explore.<br>
